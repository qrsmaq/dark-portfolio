      "From an early age I've had a fascination with technology. Raised by a single mother who couldn't always afford to buy the things I wanted, I learned to make due with what I had.  With that in mind, I was also taught that anything is possible. I knew how to make perfect copies of CD's, DVD's, and I could download just about any movie you wanted to see. One day I asked myself how I could use these skills in service of my favorite past time; video games. I figured it out in a couple days and within a week I had rented and copied every game I liked from Blockbuster.",
